# Insomnia (2024)

> I know when it happens. It is not a normal sleep deprivation or sleeplessness. My mind goes into a loop of thoughts and anxiety. I become scared and wake up several times perspirating or with elevated heart rates in my attempts to sleep.

It's high time that I must observe some patterns and log entries for the same. I have to cure it now.

## 19 Sep

- Drank coffee twice, morning and after 5pm.
- Too much anxiety and stress build up due to layoff of Manvendra sir whom I (and all of my teammates) knew closely.
- Trying to sleep at 22:30 but waking up in fear many times.
- Eye pain, both temples pain.
- Heartbeat fast and slow.
- Body already wanted to sleep, body felt tired and weak but brain looped into hyper active state.
- Called Surath at 23:00 to help me relieve stress, had a walk in society and talked for 2 hours. Then my head became relaxed and I was able to sleep at 01:00.
